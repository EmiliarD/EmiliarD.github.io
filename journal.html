	<h1>ğŸŒŸJournal Entry #1ğŸŒŸ</h1>
	<p>Today we learned how to do different fonts. I'm kind of tired right now because I had procrastinated on work and needed to get it done. I have a math quiz today which I'm pretty scared for but I hope I will do well. It is a Thursday so I have a lot of work but we won our game yesterday 4-0 and I assisted so I'm excited for our game tomorrow vs Poly Prep.</p>

	<p>we worked on if else today which i think i understand well. we made a square change color back and forth and then i make it small and fast so its a little game where you try to change the box's color but it's hard.
