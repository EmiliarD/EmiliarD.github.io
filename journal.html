	<h1>ðŸŒŸJournal Entry #1ðŸŒŸ</h1>
	<p>Today we learned how to do different fonts. I'm kind of tired right now because I had procrastinated on work and needed to get it done. I have a math quiz today which I'm pretty scared for but I hope I will do well. It is a Thursday so I have a lot of work but we won our game yesterday 4-0 and I assisted so I'm excited for our game tomorrow vs Poly Prep.</p>
