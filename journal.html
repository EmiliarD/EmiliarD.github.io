	<h1>🌊Journal Entry #1🌊</h1>
	<p>today i made a pink square that turns into a circle and i like the subtle color change.</p>
	<br>
	<h1>🫧Journal Entry #2🫧</h1>
	<p>today i made a bunch of speak now album covers and i really like it especially how there's a little easter egg with the one that turns into the old version.</p>
	<br>
	<h1>💧Journal Entry #3💧</h1>
	<p>Today we learned how to do different fonts. I'm kind of tired right now because I had procrastinated on work and needed to get it done. I have a math quiz today which I'm pretty scared for but I hope I will do well. It is a Thursday so I have a lot of work but we won our game yesterday 4-0 and I assisted so I'm excited for our game tomorrow vs Poly Prep.</p>

	<p>We did a lot of stuff today. I'm currently working on this journal entry and then i have to add a bunch of projects that i did to my website and push them. we did animations and this class we did functions which i think are kind of cofusing but I believe I got it. i really like the colors and shapes i used in my animation.</p>
	<br>
	<h1>🐬Journal Entry #6🐬</h1>
	<p>I've been working on making my projects page nicer and its not great right now but it will be. we also did out first thing in java which is cool because it makes a little alert.</p>
	<br>
	<h1>🐙Journal Entry #7🐙</h1>
	<p>I made my jumpscare today! I think that It's super cute. And I'm happy with it because i really like how it seems bad but is actually a nice surprise.</p>
	<br>
	<h1>🐠Journal Entry #8🐠</h1>
	<p>I made a little thanksgiving clock today and i think the turkeys are so cute and small and I love it.</p>
	<br>
	<h1>🐋Journal Entry #9🐋</h1>
	<p>I'm trying to make a gift for my grandpa's 80th birthday but its not working super well but i am working on it so i hope it ends up good</p>
	<br>
	<h1>🐳 Journal Entry #10🐳</h1>
	<p>my gift for my grandpa is goind well. I just had a lab about it and we worked on making the images appear every second by using the counter to change the images and i understand it pretty well. I'm working on it a bit more still. I like how the images appear at even intervals.</p>

	<h1>🐡Journal Entry #12🐡</h1>
	<p>I made a funny thing of steph's face today and i like how it moves around randomly but it's big enough that i can still pay attention to it.
	</p>
	<br>
	<h1>🦈Journal Entry #13🦈</h1>
	<p>i worked on the changing circle today so we basically worked on randomly changing colors using Math.random and the rgb values. I think it looks really cool with the different colors.
	</p>
	<br>
	<h1>🐚Journal Entry #14🐚</h1>
	<p>we worked on if else today which i think i understand well. we made a square change color back and forth and then i make it small and fast so its a little game where you try to change the box's color but it's hard.
	</p>
	<br>
	<h1>🦞Journal Entry #15🦞</h1>
	<p>i made a cute birthday/channukah gift for my mother today and i really like the photos of her because I think it is fun.

	<p>Today we worked on making a slot machine. mine isn't fully done but that's ok and right now i am working on making all of the different animals in my projects page move aroung and I have two of them done so far!

	<br>
	<h1>🏴‍☠️Journal Entry #17🏴‍☠️</h1>
	<p>I continued to work on my slot machine today and i think that i really improved it. it now says the score and just looks a lot nicer in my mind.
	</p>
	<br>
	<h1>🏖️Journal Entry #18🏖️</h1>
	<p>today we made confetti and i think it looks pretty cool because it comes out of the corner and is randomly colored. i am now using it to make a valentines day card.
	</p>
	<br>
	<h1>🏝️Journal Entry #19🏝️</h1>
	<p>I've been working on the valentines day card for steph for a while and i finally finished it and i really like how i made the confetti come out of the popper diagonally. I wanted to make the whole thing pink and red so it looks liek kind of a lot of one color but other than that I really like it.
	</p>
	<br>
	<h1>⛵Journal Entry #20⛵</h1>
	<p>I've been working on making my projects move more and it is pretty boring but the more i do and the more it comes together the better it looks so i will continue and i think i will like it.
	</p>
	<br>
	<h1>🏄Journal Entry #21🏄</h1>
	<p>today we all talked about a mini quiz thing that was just like how do i do this thing and then how do you do a different situation and it was fine. It helped me remember some stuff like arrays and for loops but i liked it.
	</p>
	<br>
	<h1>⚓Journal Entry #22⚓</h1>
	<p>today we all talked about inputs and made a little thing and saw carson's page. I think I am pretty confident in it and understand it relatively well.
